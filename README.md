# interpolation_assignment

Description: Write a program that will form the representative polynomial for a given set of two dimensional data points. This program should be able to print out the final polynomial (eg if there are 10 datapoints, P9(x)). the program should also be able to use the generated polynomial to calculate a point x within the dataset where x <=n and x>0.

The tournament is won based on: 

1) Accuracy, if the answer should be 1/3 and your program prints out 0.33333 and the opponent's program can display 1/3 instead of the fraction, victory is awarded to the opponent.

2) if for some reason you can prove that your opponent's polynomial cannot represent all the datapoints, you win

3) if all else is equal then the victor is determined by the speed of the program excution.
